# Getting started 

Hey, 

Thank you for your purchase. This is a short getting-started file, a complete documentation for the theme is located in `html/docs` folder or [online](https://demo.bootstrapious.com/directory/1-5/docs/docs-introduction.html).

**To get started, there are basically two main possibilities.**

1. Using already compiled HTML and CSS files
2. Using Gulp

## Using already compiled HTML and CSS files

`HTML` folder is the place where all the HTML pages are located. The pages here form a demo static site, mostly equivalent to the online demo (source not minified and CDNs not used here).

You can open any of the files in your browser to see it in action, or modify their markup or content to suit your needs.

## Using Gulp

To make your life even easier, this template comes with a thoughtfully prepared Gulp workflow.

With almost no initial setup, you can develop with an automatic Pug (or HTML) and SCSS compilation, use BrowserSync’s live-reload local server and have theme’s 3rd party libraries always up-to-date and copied into the template.

See more about the [Gulp workflow](https://demo.bootstrapious.com/directory/1-5/docs/docs-gulp.html) and [customizing the SCSS](https://demo.bootstrapious.com/directory/1-5/docs/docs-customizing-css.html).
